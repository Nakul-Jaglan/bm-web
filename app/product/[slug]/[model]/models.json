BON-P-GE-7.0HP is a model of the gas engine by Bonhoeffer, which is a 4-stroke gas engine with 4000 maximum RPM. A gas engine consists of different types of systems through which fuel is converted into energy. This process is the result of various actions such as combustion, compression, intake, and power. Combustion is an important process that occurs inside the engine cylinders in which air and fuel are mixed and combusted by an electric spark. Pistons will automatically move up and down inside the cylinder with the heat and pressure."
