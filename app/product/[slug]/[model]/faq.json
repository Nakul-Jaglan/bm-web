            "question": "How to Storage my Bonhoeffer water pump Tips",
            "answer": "Flush the pump case with clean fresh water, then completely drain to prevent damage from freezing. Cover intake and discharge ports to prevent the entry of debris during storage. The term Self Priming is actually an industry term that describes the ability of a pump to create a partial vacuum by purging air from the intake hose and pump casing. All Honda pumps are self priming by definition. All self priming pumps require water to be added to the pump casing to start the priming process."

            "question": "What are the priming tips for Bonhoeffer water pump",
            "answer": "Place the pump as close to the water source as possible. The less lift required will improve priming time. Fill the pump case completely with water (Never operate a centrifugal pump without water in the pump casing). Start the pump engine. By partially restricting the discharge hose, priming time can be improved. Shutting off a pump will allow water to flow out of the suction hose, requiring priming. The use of a foot valve on the end of the suction hose will prevent water from flowing out of the suction hose if you stop the pump and reduce time required for the pump to regain its prime. Wear off the volute and Impeller can decrease pump performance and increase time required to prime the pump. Regular inspection and maintenance of your pump will maintain peak performance."
