            "question": "How to Storage my Bonhoeffer water pump Tips",
            "answer": "Flush the pump case with clean fresh water, then completely drain to prevent damage from freezing. Cover intake and discharge ports to prevent the entry of debris during storage. The term Self Priming is actually an industry term that describes the ability of a pump to create a partial vacuum by purging air from the intake hose and pump casing. All Honda pumps are self priming by definition. All self priming pumps require water to be added to the pump casing to start the priming process."

            "question": "What are the priming tips for Bonhoeffer water pump",
            "answer": "Place the pump as close to the water source as possible. The less lift required will improve priming time. Fill the pump case completely with water (Never operate a centrifugal pump without water in the pump casing). Start the pump engine. By partially restricting the discharge hose, priming time can be improved. Shutting off a pump will allow water to flow out of the suction hose, requiring priming. The use of a foot valve on the end of the suction hose will prevent water from flowing out of the suction hose if you stop the pump and reduce time required for the pump to regain its prime. Wear off the volute and Impeller can decrease pump performance and increase time required to prime the pump. Regular inspection and maintenance of your pump will maintain peak performance."

            "answer": "Bonhoeffer water pumps are developed, tested and certified with petroleum based motor oils as a lubricant. Synthetic oils may be used; however, any motor oil used in our water pump must meet all oil requirements as stated in the owner manual. In addition, recommended oil change intervals must be followed."

            "answer": "If a problem occurs with the spark plug: Check the spark plug HT wire and connect it if necessary. Remove the spark plug cap. Clean any dirt from around the spark plug base, and then remove the spark plug. Grounding the side electrode to the engine, pull the recoil starter to see if sparks jump across the gap. If there is no spark, replace the plug. If there is a spark, reinstall the spark plug and start again. If the air cleaner is clogged, clean or replace the air cleaner. If the carburetor is clogged, clean the carburetor (see our carburettor workshop sheet). Check if the valve clearance is correct. If not, readjust the valve clearance to the correct setting with a filler gauge. Check if the governor is out of adjustment. If so, readjust the governor. If the problem is not solved, take your water pump to an authorised Bonhoeffer dealer."

            "answer": "Bonhoeffer engines are designed and certified to run on regular unleaded gasoline containing no more than 5% ethanol (E10). Gasoline is allowed, by regulation, to contain a variety of additives. The same regulation limits how much of some additives, such as alcohol, can be included in the fuel and still allow it to be sold as gasoline. If you look in a Bonhoeffer product owner's manual, you will see that a maximum of 5% ethanol is allowed (other oxygenates are also listed). Bonhoeffer engines are designed for good performance and efficient operation using gasoline containing from 0 to 5% ethanol.
