&lt;p&gt;An air compressor is a device that sucks air from the atmosphere, compress it and then stores it in a tank. The compressed air in the tank can be used later to perform any pneumatic task. A pneumatic task (any task or tool which requires highly pressurized air) could be starting a tool by highly pressurized air or to pump air in your car&amp;rsquo;s wheel. Bonhoeffer machines provide the best direct driven air compressor. Direct driven air compressor has a crankshaft straightaway to the motor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Direct-driven air compressor should be your go to choice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compressor type is best for the professional and industrial use. Less energy is consumed while operating that means more money is saved. In maintenance, you just need to take care of a few components. BON-P-DDAC-25L is the direct-driven air compressor with 25L tank capacity. With this tank capacity you can perform tasks like dusting and cleaning, tyre inflation, spray painting and many more. In terms of portability, you can move around the machine easily. Thanks to strong and durable wheels. You need 100 PSI pressure to perform most of your tasks, but Bonhoeffer gives 115 PSI with this machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gas engine is ideal for the high energy operations. When you are looking for the best quality gasoline engines, only a few brands are credible, and Bonhoeffer is one of them. Bonhoeffer Gasoline Engines are reliable, efficient, and powerful for the various operations in agriculture and other industries. BON-P-GE-7.0HP is a model of the gas engine by Bonhoeffer, which is a 4-stroke gas engine with 4000 maximum RPM. A gas engine consists of different types of systems through which fuel is converted into energy. This process is the result of various actions such as combustion, compression, intake, and power. Combustion is an important process that occurs inside the engine cylinders in which air and fuel are mixed and combusted by an electric spark. Pistons will automatically move up and down inside the cylinder with the heat and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
